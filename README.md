## PySonar2 - a deep static analyzer for Python

PySonar2 is a static analyzer for Python, which does interprocedural analysis to
infer types. To understand its properties, please refer to my blog posts:

### How to build

    mvn package



### System Requirements

* Python 2.7.x is recommended (Python <= 2.5 does not work, Python 2.6 works for
  some people but not all)

* Python 3.x if you have Python3 files

PySonar2 uses CPython interpreter to parse Python code, so please make sure you
have `python` or `python3` installed and pointed to by the `PATH` environment
variable. If you have them in different names, please make symbol links.

`PYTHONPATH` environment variable is used for locating the Python standard
libraries. It is important to point it to the correct Python library, for
example

    export PYTHONPATH=/usr/lib/python2.7

If this is not set up correctly, you may find suboptimal results.



### How to use

PySonar2 is mainly designed as a library for Python IDEs and other developer
tools, so its interface may not be as appealing as an end-user tool, but for
your understanding of the library's capabilities, a reasonably nice demo program
has been built (all features added by Steve Yegge, all bugs added by Yin Wang).

Now you can build a simple "code-browser" of the Python 2.7 standard library
with the following command line:

    java -jar target/pysonar-2.0-SNAPSHOT.jar /usr/lib/python2.7 ./html

This will take a few minutes. You should find some interactive HTML files inside
the _html_ directory after this process.



### Memory Usage

PySonar2 doesn't need much memory to do analysis. 1.5Gb is probably enough for
analyzing a medium sized project such as Python's standard library or Django.
But for generating the HTML files, you may need quite some memory (~2.5Gb for
Python 2.7 standard lib). This is due to the highlighting code is putting all
code and their HTML tags into the memory.
